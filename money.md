You have already heard about bitcoin. Ethereum is described often described
as a "world computer", because it is a general purpose blockchain that can
be programmed with smart contracts to do any arbitrary computation. The
bitcoin blockchain cannot, because it is limited to a simple scripting
language, and it is difficult to do arbitrary computations on it. This is the
main thing that differentiates the two. Bitcoin functions solely as a
currency, like any currency does. It is used for simple transactions, or as a
store of value, and cannot be "programmed". 

Ethereum, on the other hand, can be. What does it mean to have programmable 
money? This sounds like an abstract and absurd notion, but really, it's not.
It helps to think of money not as a hard, physical thing like gold, or coins,
or green paper. Because when we think of money this way, we start thinking of
it as a pure, natural thing, as an element of the physical world, like fire or
water or electricity is, something that was discovered. In reality, money was
not something discovered, it is simply another human invention. We tend to
think of it as a discovery since humans have been transferring value between
each other for nearly all our history.

But in reality, money is fake. It only has value because we humans believe
it has value. And we believe it has value because other people believe it
has value because other people and so on and so forth. And we all believe
it has value because a strong and stable government backs it and says: this
thing has value. And so what we have invented is a relatively stable
mechanism to transfer value between nearly anyone. But since money is a purely
social engineering feat, there need to be rules, put in place by us huamns,
to make sure this system doesn't spiral into chaos. And so there are rules
on interest rates, the printing of money, etc., all to keep this system in
check. And so really, money is already "programmed" in a social sense, 
because it is the rules of money that are programmed.

In the same sense, this is how cryptocurrency on Ethereum can be programmed.
The raw, native currency (ether) isn't really being morphed, but rather rules
on how to use it can be. And so this has led to a whole movement called DeFi
where essentially people can program financial rules about money. And I mean
this is where the power of money really comes from right? This notion of
finance, of lending, borrowing, saving, and investing.

But now instead of humans setting these rules like hey, the bank must keep
x% of its money in reserve, or, the lending company charges 4% interest, and
you trust their word because of contracts, and law, and regulation, now, you
"trust" the code. Now, these rules, which were previously enforced by
contracts, now are written in code. Now, a function in some smart contract
says "charge x% interest" or whatever you want. And so many new startups are
springing up that are writing these smart contracts, and offering these
decentralized financial services to everyone.
